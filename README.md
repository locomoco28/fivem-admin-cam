# TODO

- Make player invisible
  - follow targetted player so map loads properly around it
- Make free movable cam
- Create GUI to select players to watch (instead of using command)
- Test with players

Currently I'm only spawning a test ped inside a cop car which drives around. I need to attach it to actual players which should be as easy as selecting the player ped by id, so I want to wait until I get everything working properly since I can't just easily start up a second GTA instance to try it out on real players ^^
