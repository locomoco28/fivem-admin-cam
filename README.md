# V0.2 Preview Video

[Example video (V0.2.7)](https://streamable.com/ofl1oj)

_Forgot to mute music again and didn't move the whole window into the screen but whatever eh_

Something that hasn't been shown in the video: when holding the trigger button (R/B) to change the FOV, the movement input gets blocked in favor to the keyboard controls (Zoom In/Out: W/S)

_Trigger type = button to hold for referenced movement_

# Issues

- Movement happens relative to the world
  - It's not impacted by the rotation of the player which makes the controls kinda confusing

# TODO

- ~~Make free movable cam~~
- Create GUI to select players to watch (instead of using command)
- Test with players

Currently I'm only spawning a test ped inside a cop car which drives around. I need to attach it to actual players which should be as easy as selecting the player ped by id, so I want to wait until I get everything working properly since I can't just easily start up a second GTA instance to try it out on real players ^^

# control_ui

There is a `control_ui.js` file in the root of the project. This is a potential feature for the future, showing the controls the spectated player is pressing. Requires a little more work, but I am worried abt the resource usage as input data would need to be streamed to the server from all clients. Of course, the server could trigger the client to stream the data, I'm not quite sure if the client can detect it which could be abused by players.
