_Forgot to turn off Twitch overlay and mute music heh_

| Keyboard/Mouse | Controller | Action     |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| C              | R3         | Zoom in    |
| E              | L3         | Zoom out   |
| Mouse right    | R3 right   | Look right |
| Mouse down     | R3 down    | Look down  |
| [/](#Bugs)     | R3 left    | Look left  |
| [/](#Bugs)     | R3 up      | Look up    |

# Bugs

- Looking left/up doesn't work when spectating vehicle with mouse yet. Only right stick on controller!
- Mouse needs high sensititvity

# V0.1.2 (Not shown in the video)

- I just added the feature that you can hold C/R3 when setting the FOV and then use your controller's trigger or W/S to zoom in/out

# TODO

- Make player invisible
  - follow targetted player so map loads properly around it
- Make free movable cam
- Create GUI to select players to watch (instead of using command)
- Test with players

Currently I'm only spawning a test ped inside a cop car which drives around. I need to attach it to actual players which should be as easy as selecting the player ped by id, so I want to wait until I get everything working properly since I can't just easily start up a second GTA instance to try it out on real players ^^
